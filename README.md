# encryption-decryption

- Encrypted files consist of numbers from 0 to 6. The numbers represents some characters such as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are ‘ ’, ‘-’, ‘_’, ‘|’, ‘/’, ‘\’, ‘O‘ respectively.

- Some files don’t mean anything when we use this description function, so we use the formula below to decyrpt them.

- The O is our position and it is constant. E represents the enemies’ current position. X and Y is the
current axes of the position of the enemy camp. R shows the distance between current position and
the last position of the enemy camp. D is the distance of enemy to our camp. The machine should
work until the operator gives ‘E’ command to machine and it has to refresh the view of screen on
each ‘R’ command. The prototype of the function of that machine is as below:
